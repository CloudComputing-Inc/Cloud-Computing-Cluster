       "'I had an 8-year-old micro sd card reader (see photo), also made by Kingston, and it wouldn\\'t read my new SanDisk micro sd card. I called Kingston, and they said it MAY be that the 8-year-old card reader that I was using could be the problem. That maybe my old card would be better suited finding a drive-in movie theater and watching this new, juggernaut of a film called E.T.<br />So, you\\'re telling me it\\'s old, then? lol. Uh...YEAH.<br /><br />I plugged in the micro sd card to this new Kingston reader, \\x00and it worked perfectly. Windows popped up right away with a window asking what I wanted to do.  Transfer files, please.<br /><br />Here\\'s the fantastic part:<br />I transferred 50.5 GB in less than 5 minutes! Maybe faster than that, I shoulda timed it. It would move\\x00, like 400 MB, in the count of 3! Just super, SUPER fast (If you\\'re reading this review in 2028, try not to bust a rib laughing at how slow that is!).<br />My computer has a USB 3.0 and this card is also 3.0 speed (you can tell this because the tab inside the USB port will be BLUE). If you DON\\'T see a blue tab on your computer, then this will NOT transfer files nearly as fast.<br /><br />I also like that \"SD\" is engraved on one side of the reader and \"Micro SD\" is engraved on the other in case you weren\\'t sure. This reader does read SD and MicroSD.<br /><br />I can\\'t speak to the durability cuz I\\'ve only used it once. I don\\'t plan on using this to change my car tire, \\x00so I suspect it will last a while.<br /><br />I also would\\'ve liked to see some kind of a cute little case to hold this in. It IS exposed to the elements of whatever drawer you keep it in without a case to protect it from dust, etc\\x00.<br />I posted a picture of a little box I got at the container store for a dollar. It\\'s a nice fit.<br />Hope this was helpful!'"
